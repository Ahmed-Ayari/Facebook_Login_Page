- 👀 I’m obviously interested in coding, discovering, learning and trying new things  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java, JavaScript and everything related to web and game development as I still haven't chosen the field that I want to develop myself fully in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's related to computer science as long as I get the experience and knowledge needed to advance in my field
